# Feefty admin test

[Github Repository](https://github.com/Feefty/feefty-admin-test)

## Intro

Welcome to Feefty Admin Test!

The goal of this repo is to be a base to build on, in order to see how you approach web development on a stack similar to ours.

And hopefully, to make it worthwhile for you, we'll use recent tech so you can discover and try new things!

The test is simple, it focuses on creating a simple web app from scratch with a CRUD interface for a list of users.

Please fork this repo first and push it on your own github repo in public.

Feefty is a design-driven company, we'll pay attention to the delivered interface and its closeness to the mockups.

To deliver the test please send us the link to your repo. You don't have to host it anywhere, we'll run it locally.

## Outcome

The goal is to set up a simple CRUD interface for a list of users.
The final app should include:

- A global "Add user" button opens a new page with a form to add a user. The form uses the same design of the Edit form minus the Danger zone.
- A list of users.
- For each user, an "Edit" button that open a page to edit the user information. The form include a Delete button to delete the user. The deletion needs a user confirmation before deleting.
- For each user, an "Activate / Deactivate" button to toggle the user status.

Please respect the mockup [available here on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ivV7OQ4cpnh9W2DmaMWn2c/Test-UI?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=WRrllQCg4gX3ib4O-1)

## Stack

### Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) using yarn.

We'll use [Next.js 13 with the new App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) part of the last stable release. It includes a new structure and a different approach to routing with Server Component and [Client component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#client-components).

Use Server Component as much as possible, but use Client Component when there is interactivity / state management.

Next.js 13 also includes an alpha feature for Server Actions, allowing you to submit form directly from Server Components. This feature is in alpha and is very limited. For example, there is no way to handle errors on the server side currently.
If you'd like to try it, please do but be aware of the limitations and you'll probably spent much more time to get it right.

Otherwise, simply use fetch to submit the form to an API endpoint like you'd do with a regular Next.js app.

### Prisma / PostgreSQL

We use PostgreSQL on all of our projects and use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs) as our ORM of choices.

### Tailwind / Styled components

This project is set up to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). We don't usually use Tailwind at Feefty but [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Feel free to use the tool you prefer.

### Others

Feel free to use any other library you'd like to use.

The following list are libraries we use in our different projects. This is only for information, you don't have to specifically use them:

- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) or [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) or [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form management.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/) or [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI.
- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) for icons
- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) or [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) for Toasts

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies :

```bash
yarn
#or
yarn install
```

Create a database for your project, either locally or on a cloud provider.

> **_⚠️_** On cloud provider, you will need to create a [shadow database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database) manually

Create a `.env` file and setup your database connection :

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

Run the prisma migration to create the database schema :

```bash
yarn prisma migrate dev
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
